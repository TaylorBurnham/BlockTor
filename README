				Block TOR

- About -
The purpose of this script is to block TOR exit nodes from
accessing your server via IP tables.

- Usage -
Run as root/sudo. You may also put it in a cron tab but I
wouldn't run it more than once per day, if that. I have it
set to run once per week on my servers.

- Disclaimer -
This script is provided AS-IS. Any damage to your system, 
lost revenue, lost productivity, etc. is on YOU, the USER.

- Additional Comments -
This script is not meant to infringe on users who have
valid uses for TOR. This is meant to add an additional
layer of security to your servers. In my experience, I
don't think anybody accessing my servers /needs/ to be
on TOR and for the most part I have received more bad than
good via the protocol, so I just block it.

Conversation is good. Shoot me an e-mail if you wish to
give input or discuss this further.
